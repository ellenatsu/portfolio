  "With over two years of experience as a Junior App Developer and my recent venture into freelance development, I have developed a deep passion for crafting visually impressive and functionally robust websites and applications.",
  "My journey in technology started with Android app development, where I honed my skills in maintaining and updating SDKs for gaming applications. However, my enthusiasm for web development grew as I discovered the vast creative possibilities it offers compared to mobile applications. ",
  "This led me to transition into web development, where I have since built everything from e-commerce sites to complex web-based chat interfaces using state-of-the-art technologies like React and Firebase.",

Whether it’s integrating new payment functionalities into a platform or pioneering a company’s shift to web-based operations, I thrive on challenges and continuously push the boundaries of what I can create with code.",
  "Currently, I am immersed in developing an online marketplace for traditional Chinese goods and a web-based chatbot that leverages AI to enhance user interactions with Buddhist texts. These projects not only sharpen my technical skills but also allow me to explore innovative ways to merge technology with culture and history.",
